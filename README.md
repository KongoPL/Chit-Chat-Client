# Chit Chat
Chit Chat is server-less chat with solutions that has been created to give you maximum of privacy. By server-less I mean that almost no data are transmitted through server - no messages, no profiles data etc. Also, it has encryption that makes it all even more safer!

# Goals of project
1. Transmit as few data to server as possible and create chat
2. Encrypt data on your own

## Additional things I learned/did
1. Big binary number calculator
2. Own way to transfer data as raw binary, transmit it and decode (in JS it's little bit tricky to do it)
3. Markdown formatting
